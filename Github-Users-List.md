# Mobile Test - Github Users List App

## User Stories

1. As a user on app first launch,
    - When I reach the home page
    - Then I should see a list of github users. Each user item on this page should show: name, avatar, the home page URL
    - And I should see a search box
2. As a user on the home page,
    - When I tap on a user item
    - Then I should see the user's details
3. As a user on the item details page,
    - Then I should see user's home page loaded with the home page URL
4. As a user on the home page,
    - When I focus on to the search bar
    - And enter search terms
    - Then I should see the corresponding news result lists based on the search terms real time
